      <h1>Rob Nelson <i class="fas fa-running"></i> About Me</h1>
      <p>Inspired Software Developer skilled in all aspects of the SDLC, team leadership, customer interaction, and system deployment. Works best when faced with ambiguous requirements and tasked to develop a solution through iteratively working with clients and end-users. Extensive hands-on experience in database development, data loading, architecture and design, Python, Java, Windows, and Linux.</p>
      <p>Working knowledge of electronic healthcare record parsing, transport, and storage. Created utilities for synthetic record generation used in testing and training of Web-based EHR systems.</p>
      <p>I've spent a good deal of my free time the last year studying HTML/CSS/JS, the MERN stack and the technologies that support development of modern applications and architectures. My objective isn't simply to learn about the technologies; it's to expand my skill set and follow my passion for developing useful products for end users.</p>
      <p> There is a great deal of satisfaction to creating tools people use to address critical problems. The satisfaction is greater when the tool is up front and not hidden in the background. Creating the UI also provides opportunities to work collaboratively with the end users. My ultimate goal is to land another position leading a team in developing or growing a Web-based tool that benefits the public.</p>
