          host 100TB of data and support analysis through performant querying.
          The approach I designed for the team, involved the following steps:
          <ul>
            <li>Define requirements and constraints to include (cost, schedule, storage size, power, cooling, ability to
              query, "flat" architecture, low side/high side--loading fast on H/S)</li>
            <li>Define evaluation methods for systems and write an alternatives analysis -- what are the tactical
              advantages to an approach and what are the strategic advantages</li>
            <li>Recognize the challenges the future is likely to to bring to our project and will the platform grow/can
              it provide additional capabilities</li>
            <li>Use the criteria to identify the systems for additional consideration based on a paper study of likely
              candidates</li>
            <li>Build a team and plan for system evaluations with real data and queries running on the candidate
              hardware platforms</li>

          <p>The system we purchased was a software only solution, that we ran on commodity Dell hardware. An issue we
            faced is the vendor suggested we use 10Gb as the interconnect. 10Gb hardware was very expensive at the time;
            We were able to accomplish equivalent performance running TCP over Infiniband-4 (IB-4).</p>

        The TMDS/MSAT Electronic Medical Records (EMR) system tracks service members' medical history through data
        integration from many internal and external data sources. The team doesn't have access to these systems, so I

          Ideally we would have copies of the same external applications so we can generate files to load longitudinal
          medical records into our EMR system. This hasn't been feasible due to resource constraints. I have developed a
          few tools to create synthetic EMR for use in training and testing:
          <ul>
            <li>Worked with domain experts to identify scenarios that matched what would be expected from clinical
              records as well as data sets that tested the TMDS/MSAT system.</li>
            <li>Create a random patient demographics generator in Python to ensure PII isn't inadvertently entered in
              the systems. Simmulated patient medical data was used for training in and testing of TMDS/MSAT systems.
            </li>
            <li>Implemented a Blood donation synthetic data generator to automatically create blood donations for
              training and testing (Python).</li>
            <li>Data message patient demographics remapper used to refresh messages so scenarios can be retested
              (Python); Changed the patient demographics information so external data files could be reused in testing
              and training TMDS/MSAT.</li>
            <li>Synthetic message generator to map patients into representative longitudinal medical records used in
              training and testing (Java/JSON).</li>
            <li>Message to JSON parser to support scenario based, data driven testing of application business rules.

        The ideal situation for product development is developes' access to domain experts and clients. I had an
        experience at PNNL where I worked very closely with analysts and cyber-security domain experts to build a
        solution. <span class="dots" id="dots-text-analysis">...</span><span class="more-text"
          id="hidden-text-analysis">
          Working collaboratively with analysts resulted in a DevOps-like environment where features were conceptualized
          and delivered in a matter of hours rather than months.</p>

          SQL and Python provide light-weight tools to quickly demonstrate capability and then codify the result for
          deployment into a production environment: In working one-on-one with end users, I was able to quickly
          prototype ideas that could then be deployed and used in a quick turnaround.
          These interactions with cyber domain experts, analysts, and analysis consumers lead to:
          <ul>
            <li>Developing analytical tool that captured domain knowlege and put more analysts on equal footing.</li>
            <li>Creating a GUI based query tool that allowed anaysts to focus on problems, not SQL queries and
              infrastructure.</li>
            <li>Exploring and implementing ontologies that highlight hidden traits in the data.</li>

            solutions. The insights provided by true domain experts trumps technical elegance of a solution. This
            experience led to significant, personal career advancements. It also drove home to me the

        My initial exposure to Python was in a DevOps type environment where I worked side-by-side with analysts and the
        production team to implement ETL and Analysis tools for a Big Data analysis system. <span class="dots"
          id="dots-text-python">...</span><span class="more-text" id="hidden-text-python">I
          chose Python to
          implement a thick client, in order increase analysts abilty to retrieve data dynamically from the big data platform.
          The thick client dynamically generated and execute SQL queries for analysts based on selection criteria they 
          entered into the interface. Python provide a great deal of fexability for accessing multiple data source in 
          parallel which reduced query times and data collation from days to hours. The thick client was a data extraction method 
          that allowed analysts to focus on the problem and not worry about how to get the data. 
          
          Python became a lanugage I used to create tools, perform ETL, build data
          simulators, and automate IT functions. Some other projects, besides the query tool, where I used python:
          <ul>
            <li>ETL code of sensor data into a massively parallel processing database
              platform.</li>
            <li>ETL for parsing client spreadsheets, then loading into a NoSQL analytical database platform.</li>
            <li>Data generation and message remapping utilities.</li>

          <p>I've continued to develop and learn Python more indeptly through independent study. Python provides a great
            tool for implementing new features in a rapid development environment. In addition to developing in Python,

            Python is a great language for developing tools and applications that require rapid development. It is also
            a great language for implementing DevOps solutions, such as automating IT functions, ETL, and data
            generation. Python's flexibility and ease of use make it a great choice for many projects.</p>

        I led a team with the charter to create a web-based analytical platform supporting remote sites across the US. I
        knew a linear waterfall methodology wouldn't yield a good solution. I sought a better approach and Iterative
        development (SCRUM) looked like a great alternative. I know many say SCRUM is dead, but <span class="dots" id="dots-text-planning">...</span>
        <span class="more-text" id="hidden-text-planning">
        I feel it's not the process that was the problem, it's how most organizations tried to mold it to meet their management style.
          <br><br>
          I realized this was a cultural shift for the engineers and Government client. In order to bring about the
          cultural shift, I arranged training in Agile SCRUM for the whole team, including the Government client. This
          was intended to level-set the team in Agile development methodology.
          <br><br>
          We formed a cross functional team whose members were included in every phase of the project. The team was comprised of:
          <ul>
            <li>A Product Owner (Government Client)</li>
            <li>A project manager who helped track budgets, prepare status
              reports, and take care of project administration (the bridge between Agile and traditional project
              management)</li>
            <li>Developers</li>
            <li>Technical Writer</li>
            <li>Tester</li>
            <li>Project Admin</li>
            <li>Project Leader</li>
          </ul>
          As project leader, I identifying the requirements (working with the Product Owner, Analysts, Technical Experts, and
          Production Team), techical direction, and tasks we were taking on.
          <br><br>
          I recruited the team members at PNNL and identified the approach for running the project (SCRUM). I saw to it 
          the team, including the product owner, were train in the SCRUM process by professional trainers. We were able to 
          follow the SCRUM process, since team members had been trained in the process and bought into the approach. We were 
          able to deliver a system that eventually replaced the thick-client Python GUI.
          <br>
          Including a project manager in the team was a key to allow the team to employ agile development while maintaining 
          comfort for management. The project manager was able to track the budget, prepare status reports, and take care of
          project administration. The project manager was the bridge between Agile and traditional project management.
          <H3>Take Away</H3>
          While many organizations feel Agile has failed them, I've used Agile as an oppourtunity for collaborative development 
          between technical staff and domain experts. The team I led was able to successfully implement
          Agile SCRUM because we took the time to train the team and the Product Owner in the process. We  included subject matter 
          experts who understand the requirements and constraints of the project, then developed a system that met there approval in 
          small successes. 
          
          Agile is collaborative development with domain experts and end users who must be integrated into the team. Now AI agents
          streamline this process as a developer can sit sholder-to-shoulder with an end user and create solutions that meet their 
          needs, before their eyes.

          Web and backend development are rewarding and requires knowledge in a number of different areas. AI is a tool
          that extends developer efficiency and allows developers to focus on the user experience and
          functionality of the application. AI agents can be used to generate code and then refine it for
          efficiency and styling. AI agents can also be used to generate the code for the backend,
          which allows developers to focus on the front end and user experience. The key to building a successful
          Web-based application is to work collaboratively with the end users and domain experts to create a solution
          that meets their needs.
