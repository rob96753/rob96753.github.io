      The approach I took involved the following steps:

        <li>Define requirements and constraints to include (money, size, power, cooling, ability to query, low side/high side--loading fast on H/S)</li>

Working collaboratively with analysts resulted in a DevOps-like environment where features conceptualized and delivered in a matter of hours rather than months.

Who were the actors -- DoD was a funding source along with DOE. We had a Product Owner -- who wasn't really able to articulate what the product should be. A project manager who helped track budgets, prepare status reports, and take care of project administration, developers, technical writer, tester, project admin, and PI. I was basically charged with identifying the requirements, direction, and tasks we were taking (I was acting as the surrogate product owner).
I recruited the team members at PNNL and identified the approach for running the project (SCRUM) which we took the team, including the product owner, to training in Seattle.

Creating the UI also provides opportunities to work collaboratively with the end users.</span>
